## Features

### ✨ Syntax Highlighting
- Complete syntax highlighting for all Mica language features
- Support for all data types: `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `float32`, `float64`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `unicode`, `bool`, `string`
- Import declarations with `imp` keyword for namespace imports
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- Type casting with `as` keyword
- String literals with escape sequences
- Unicode character literals
- Line comments (`//`) and block comments (`{ }`)
- Floating-point numbers with scientific notation

### 🔧 Language Features
- **IntelliSense-ready**: Proper token classification for future language server
- **Auto-indentation**: C-style formatting with smart indentation
- **Auto-closing pairs**: Automatic closing of brackets, parentheses, quotes, and `begin`/`end` blocks
- **Comment toggling**: Easy comment/uncomment with keyboard shortcuts
- **Code folding**: Fold procedures, functions, blocks, and comments

### 🐛 Debugging Support
- Breakpoint support for `.mica` files
- Integration with GDB for native debugging of compiled executables
- DWARF v5 debug information generated by Mica compiler

### 📝 Code Snippets
16 ready-to-use code snippets:
- `program` - Complete program template
- `procedure` - Procedure declaration
- `function` - Function declaration
- `if`, `ifelse` - Conditional statements
- `while` - Loop structure
- `var`, `const`, `imp` - Variable, constant, and import declarations
- `imports` - Multiple import declarations block
- `writeln`, `readln` - I/O operations
- `cast` - Type casting
- And more!

## Language Overview

Mica is a statically-typed, compiled language featuring:
- Strong type system with type inference
- Nested procedures with lexical scoping
- Type casting and promotion
- Format strings for I/O operations
- UTF-8 source encoding with full Unicode support
- Native C interoperability without foreign function interface (FFI) overhead
- Direct compilation to x86_64 assembly (System V AMD64 ABI)
- Seamless access to C standard library and system APIs

## Why Mica?

Mica combines the clarity of Pascal-like syntax with the power of systems programming:
- **Zero-overhead C interop**: Call any C library directly without FFI wrappers
- **Educational yet practical**: Learn compiler construction with a real, usable language
- **Debuggable**: Full DWARF v5 support for GDB integration
- **Transparent compilation**: See the assembly code and intermediate compiler internal representations your program generates

## Example

```mica
{ Fibonacci sequence calculator }
program fibonacci;

var
    n, a, b, temp : int32;

begin
    writeln("Enter number of terms: ");
    readln(n);
    
    a := 0;
    b := 1;
    
    writeln("Fibonacci sequence:");
    writeln("%d", a);
    writeln("%d", b);
    
    while n > 2 do
    begin
        temp := a + b;
        a := b;
        b := temp;
        writeln("%d", temp);
        n := n - 1;
    end;
    
    exit := 0;
end.
```
